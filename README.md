# Self Study CS

## Background
I am an Electrical Engineering graduate and have been working in the *RF /
electronics / embedded* industry for over 4 years. However, after finally
getting my dream job abroad at *Keysight Technologies* Malaysia, I resigned
after only working for a shy of 2 years due to some personal reason. At that
point, I also realized that I am more suited to pursue a career that allows me
to work remotely, where I can stay close to my support systems yet not limiting
my growth by only allowing myself to work at local companies. **That's when I
realized that I want to be in the computing industry.**

There are other reasons why I think I am more suited to the **computing
industry**, but I will not get into it here, read [here]() if you're curious.

However, scrapping away all of my previous knowledge and experience to start
from basically "zero" is not easy. Moreover, I don't want to only have practical
skills that would get me an interview quickly without having a solid
understanding of the fundamentals. From my experience, having a holistic view of
your field of study is the upmost important thing in mastering your field of
study. That's why I searched for a "self study CS curriculum". And if you're
like me, you'll stumble upon [**Teach Yourself Computer
Science**](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). **That is the main source for my self
study journey.**

[**Teach Yourself Computer Science**](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) seems
perfect for me at first. However, I quickly realized that I lack some knowledge
that are not listed there. Moreover, I also still need some practical knowledge
on current technologies to understand how the industry is running today. **With
that additions, I came up with this self study checklist.**

## Specialization Plan

## Overview
Here is an overview of what I have and will learn throughout my self study
jouney up till now (March 2024). Started studies with progress above 75% are
marked with ðŸŸ¢, started studies with progress above 25% and below 75% are
marked with ðŸŸ¡, while studies not yet started are marked with âš«.

**Note that some topics might get more sub topics with more knowledge acquired.**
